# Changelog

Each release is a Git tag `v<version>` on the release commit, and `linear_runner/version.py`
names it. Every entry states two things for project owners:

* **Project impact:** `none`, or the exact configuration change a project, site, workspace or
  batch file needs, with the `validate-config` (or launch) message that asks for it.
* **Canary tier:** `first-issue checkpoint` (the change touches only preflight, reporting or
  documentation: launch the next batch with `--stop-after` its first issue) or `canary batch`
  (the change touches the engine, prompts, backends or models: run a canary batch on low-risk
  issues before the next production batch).

A paused or stopped batch adopts any new runner commit with `recover repin-config`, whatever
its tier. The release procedure is in the README ("Releases").

## Unreleased

### Added

* The runner-project interface version: `registry/interface.json` and
  `interface-migrations.json`. A project profile and a batch file may declare
  `interface_version`; `validate-config` refuses an older one with the migration steps and a
  newer one with a request to update the runner, and reports undeclared files (`W-205`).
  Project impact: none (declaring it is optional); declare `"interface_version": 1`.
* Every model prompt (worker and reviewer, both backends) states that the runner's task
  instructions take precedence over the repository's agent instructions on commits, Linear
  updates, checks and the handoff; README "Integrating a project" (`W-203`). Canary tier of
  this prompt change: canary batch.
* `runner.py sync-linear-template`: renders `templates/issue-contract.md` as the Linear issue
  template "Runner issue contract" (`--dry-run` prints it), checks the workspace's copy and
  records its ID in the workspace file (`issue_template`). The Linear MCP endpoint cannot
  write templates, so a missing or outdated one is pasted in Linear by hand (`W-206`).

## v2.0.0 — 2026-09-26

The first versioned release. It covers the rebuilt runner (milestone 03), the multi-backend
runner with model pools (milestone 04), run summaries (`W-200`), `recover repair` (`W-209`),
the recovery fixes from batch `split-20260925` (`W-210`) and release versioning (`W-204`).

**Project impact:** none for configurations written for the rebuilt runner, except:

* a site whose batches can select a Claude pool entry must name the executable in
  `site.executables.claude`; `validate-config` otherwise says "site.executables.claude: a
  default pool entry or a batch model_overrides entry runs on the claude backend, so the site
  must name its executable";
* a batch `model_overrides` entry naming `gpt-5.6-luna` must name `gpt-6-luna`;
  `validate-config` otherwise says "batch <id>.model_overrides.<phase>: unknown model
  'gpt-5.6-luna'". An issue label naming it (`model:gpt-5.6-luna` and the phase labels)
  fails the launch preflight for that issue instead;
* a paused batch pinned by an earlier runner commit needs `recover repin-config`; any command
  otherwise says "Configuration/guidance changed since ... was pinned".

**Canary tier:** canary batch. Milestones 03 and 04 passed their canaries (`W-182`, `W-191`)
and `recover repair` ran in batch `split-20260925`; the `W-210` recovery changes have not yet
run in a batch.

### Added

* One engine and one configuration model: registry, private overrides, site, workspace,
  project and batch layers, validated offline by `validate-config` (milestone 03).
* `runner.py launch`: model-free preflight with identity-keyed reuse, a `systemd-user`
  supervisor and a watchdog timer; no outer model session (milestone 03).
* Plain-language Linear comments from templates, an outbox for worker drafts, stop
  notifications and the needs-input mechanism (milestone 03).
* Named, recorded recoveries with a hash-chained log: `resume`, `revalidate`, `review`,
  `repair`, `budget`, `publish` (with `--accept-contract-drift`), `defer`, `cancel` and
  `repin-config` (milestones 03–04, `W-209`).
* A Claude Code backend next to Codex, ordered per-task model pools, and a start check of
  each selectable backend in the worktree during preflight (milestone 04).
* A run summary table after Done and when an issue is set aside, and usage tables in the
  batch comment (`W-200`).
* `runner.py --version`; the release is recorded in `resolved-config.json`; a batch may pin
  `runner_version` (`W-204`).

### Fixed

* Baseline checks no longer run over a resumed active issue's own uncommitted work
  (`W-210`).
* `recover cancel` works after the configuration changed, so it no longer deadlocks with
  `repin-config` (`W-210`).
* A ready implement or repair phase stopped only by its soft budget keeps its result
  (`W-210`).
* `recover repair --repin-contract` adopts a clarified criterion without a separate review
  round (`W-210`).
